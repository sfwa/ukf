/*
Runs the kinematics model on the state vector and returns a vector with the
derivative of each components (except for the accelerations, which must be
calculated directly using a dynamics model).
Contents are as follows:
    - Rate of change in position:
        (3-vector, latitude (rad/s), longitude (rad/s), altitude (m/s))
    - Rate of change in linear velocity (3-vector, m/s^2, NED frame)
    - Rate of change in linear acceleration (3-vector, m/s^3, body frame)
    - Rate of change in attitude (quaternion (x, y, z, w), 1/s, body frame)
    - Rate of change in angular velocity (3-vector, rad/s^2, body frame)
    - Rate of change in angular acceleration (3-vector, rad/s^3, body frame)
    - Rate of change in wind velocity (3-vector, m/s, NED frame)
    - Rate of change in gyro bias (3-vector, rad/s^2, body frame)
